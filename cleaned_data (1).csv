Best CPU for Budget Ballers.","this processor is great mid to high range budget builds, if your looking for a cpu for around 10k inr, this is the perfect choice, it has 6 cores and 12 threads which is quite powerful. for me, pairing it with rx 6600 gave me around 120 fps in almost all games while playing on high graphics. about the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60? while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.overall 9.5/10 product."

Disappointing Experience with Defective i5 Processor","i recently purchased an i5 processor from amazon, and unfortunately, it turned out to be defective. despite my efforts to seek assistance from amazon, their customer support proved unhelpful, leaving me frustrated with my hard-earned money seemingly down the drain. disappointed with both the product and the lack of support, i advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering this purchase."

Impressive","decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old asus x99 platform and 980ti sli (yes that old) to an asus tuf z790/12600k/tuf 4080 oc gamers edition. my old 5820k was creating a huge bottleneck issue for my gpu, which i installed about a month prior. what a difference i must say. now that i'm finally out of the stone age, i'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the pc gaming world. this current build smokes everything i throw at it so far. which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. i paired the processor and gpu with water blocks from an aio corsair system for my cpu, and a separate granzon custom loop for the gpu. all i can say is wow. fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like the division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. i highly recommend this processor/z790 motherboard/gpu combo. are there better options for better performance or there? absolutely. but for the money, i believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. i was skeptical at first, as this is the first i5 processor i ever purchased for a pc, but as i stated previously, i am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. again, i highly recommend this processor. can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick."

Great in 2023","purchased for $150 for cyber monday 2023 and it's been excellent. in cyberpunk 2077, with ray tracing on and a mix of ultra/high settings, i've reached 60-120 fps (usually hovering between 70-90) with a gigabyte eagle 4060. i've hit 500+ fps in league of legends, and with v-sync on, i've had no noticeable drop from 165 fps. on sale, this is an excellent processor and an incredible upgrade from my previous 9400f which was and still is a very capable processor. temps are very stable with a peerless assassin cooler; i don't believe i've reached or exceeded 60 degrees celsius. i haven't overclocked yet - if i even will, because current performance is excellent - but i've read that this processor overclocks a fair amount."

Excelente compra!","if you have doubts about buying through amazon, i can assure you that it is 100% reliable. the purchasing processes are easy and totally secure. the tracking system they provide is very complete and, above all, deliveries are punctual. i bought an intel core i5-12600k processor, and yet due to amazon's mistake, i received an intel core i5-14700kf. obviously it is a much better and more expensive product. it arrived fully sealed, well packaged and much earlier than expected. peru (english)i bought an intel core i5-12600k processor and for some amazon mistake i ended receiving an intel core i5-14600kf . a huge mistake from them but, oh well, im enjoying it so far.couldn't return it because it was going to take me so much time and cost me even more.totally recommended for videogames, streaming and of course any kind of design and photo jobs."

This is the best you'll get in this price range Thats it!","if you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this cpu is by no means a low end cpu dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle gpus upto gtx3060 or rx6800. just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."

Awesome","this is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming.for productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400fbut for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth.i have teated some games in it , you can check it on my yt channel r tech studio."

Good Cpu but awful Delivery","the processor is good & works fine. but the delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. as i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. i expected better from appario. apart from this the processor itself works fine."
3.4,The best gaming CPU in its price range.,"the performance is unequivocally excellent for those who want to play in full-hd while maintaining a low budget. furthermore, in many video games it plays on par with processors that cost almost twice as much and have a few more cores. it also performs very well in single core benchmarks, however in loads with many cores it obviously loses something. the double compatibility with both ddr4 and ddr5 and with pci-e 4.0 and 5.0 allows us to also choose a motherboard with a price suited to our budget, such as an h610 compatible with the i3 12000fma which only supports ddr4 and pci-e 4.0."
4.3,"Great processor, but with one important detail!","great performance with value for money. but there is a very important detail. no gpu included. in other words, your computer needs a graphics card to work, unlike other processors with a gpu included. an important detail."
4.3,It is most likely still the best mid-range gaming PC processor in 2023.,
4.3,Fast and cool for a hot price!,i bought the processor for an h1 v2 from nzxt. this runs without any problems on an asus strix b760i with 2x ddr5 6000mhz cl30. highly recommended!
4.3,perfect,delivered in perfect condition and on time
4.3,"A powerful, energy-efficient processor","the core i5-12400f is a 12th generation processor from intel, based on the alder lake architecture. it stands out for its 10 nm engraving, its support for pcie 5.0 and thunderbolt 4, as well as its compatibility with ddr4 or ddr5 memory. it is a processor without an integrated graphics circuit, which implies the use of a dedicated graphics card. the core i5-12400f has 6 high-performance cores (p-core) and 12 threads, thanks to the hyperthreading technology. it has a base frequency of 2.5 ghz and can reach up to 4.4 ghz in turbo mode. it also has an 18mb l3 cache and a 7.5mb l2 cache. the core i5-12400f delivers remarkable performance in applications and games. it shows itself capable of competing with more high-end processors, such as amd's ryzen 5 5600x or intel's core i7-11700k. it is particularly efficient in tasks that exploit multithreading, such as video encoding, compression or rendering. it also ensures optimal fluidity in the most recent games, even at high resolution. the core i5-12400f also stands out for its energy efficiency. it has a base power consumption of 65 watts and a maximum consumption of 117 watts[^1^][1]. it is therefore easy to cool and does not require an overly expensive or noisy cooling system. it also helps reduce electricity bills and environmental impact. the core i5-12400f is therefore an excellent choice for those looking for a powerful, versatile and energy-efficient processor. it offers unbeatable value for money to take full advantage of the benefits of intel's 12th generation. however, it requires a motherboard compatible with the lga1700 socket and a dedicated graphics card."
4.3,Bargain priced CPU - low power draw with great productivity and gaming performance! :),i've owned more expensive cpus - up to amd ryzen 9 and intel 13900k. in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a waste.i've downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig. it's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. i have it paired with a rtx 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 fps) in most games i max out the monitor's 144hz/fps at 1440p.one different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)the cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool. mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. during gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. benchmarking (such as cinebench and geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. i am using a two-fan deepcool as500 plus air cooler with three case 120mm fans.all in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :)
4.3,The best Intel processor for quality/price ratio,"after a long time of use and several tests, i concluded my opinions by listing the various strengths and weaknesses of this processor: multi-core performance: with six cores and twelve threads, it excels in multi-threaded tasks, such as video rendering and 3d modeling, offering remarkable performance for a mid-range processor. balanced gaming: gaming performance is solid, ensuring stable frame rates in recent games. effective thread management contributes to a better gaming experience.smooth productivity: for everyday productivity tasks such as web browsing, document processing and multitasking, the processor offers a fast and smooth experience.power consumption: thanks to the alder lake architecture and advanced manufacturing processes, power consumption is low, which contributes to greater efficiency. detailed defects of the intel i5 12400f: lack of integrated graphics: the lack of an integrated graphics unit means the need to purchase a discrete graphics card, which increases the overall cost, especially if the user does not already own one. overclocking limitations: for those interested in overclocking, the processor may not offer the same capabilities as the ""k"" variants of the same family.thermal dissipation: in intensive workloads, the processor can generate heat, requiring an adequate cooling system to prevent overheating.overall, the intel i5 12400f represents a balanced option, offering an excellent compromise between performance , price and energy efficiency. its performance varies depending on use, but overall it is a reliable processor for a variety of tasks."
4.3,It just works,"it works, low power consumption, thanks to 65tdp it does not heat up too much, in combination with ml240l in the a4-h2o housing, the maximum temperature during the stress test is ~65c, normally during gaming ~58c"
4.3,It goes brrrr,"switched from 6th gen i5 (6600k) to 12400f, i can feel the significant improvement. especially with daily tasks and games it works perfectly. i got ddr5 6000mhz cl30 ram as well, works without a problem. combined with 4060 ti, consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so far.i got a noctua cooler for it though, works really quiet and cool. perfect for the price. about 500sek cheaper than the version with integrated graphics, but there are low profile gpus in case you want it as a simple daily or office use."
4.3,Super fast and economical,"compared to my old i5 8400, a world of difference. everything loads immediately, no more delays. in combination with an rx 6600, almost all games run at 1080p at at least 75fps."
